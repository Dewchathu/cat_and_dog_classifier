# Cat and Dog Classifier

This repository contains a project for classifying images of cats and dogs using transfer learning. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages the power of pre-trained deep learning models.

## Project Structure

- `cat_and_dog_classifier_with_transfer_learning.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for the cat and dog classifier using transfer learning.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have the following packages installed:

- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy
- matplotlib
- PIL
- sklearn

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dewchathu/cat_and_dog_classifier.git
cd cat_and_dog_classifier
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook cat_and_dog_classifier_with_transfer_learning.ipynb
```

3. Run the notebook cells to train and evaluate the cat and dog classifier.

## Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Using a pre-trained model (such as VGG16, ResNet50, etc.) for feature extraction.
3. **Model Training**: Training a custom classifier on top of the pre-trained model.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.

## Results

The model achieves a high accuracy in distinguishing between images of cats and dogs by leveraging the power of transfer learning.
